# Tic-Tac-Toe

I made this little CLI game in my first year of university. 

## Features
- Simple command-line interface
- Two-player mode
- Basic game logic with win detection

## How to Play
1. Run the game in the terminal.
2. Players take turns entering their moves.
3. The first player to get three in a row wins!

## Compilation & Execution
To compile and run the game, use:
```sh
cd tic-tac-toe
gcc main.c -o tic_tac_toe
./tic_tac_toe
```
